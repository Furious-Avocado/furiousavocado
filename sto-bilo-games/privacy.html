Advertisements</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">We accept ads in various formats (such as banners, interstitial, rewarded videos, etc.) from Third Party ad networks which may be displayed in our &nbsp;Apps. These Third Party ad networks may collect and use: (i) information about your visits to &nbsp;Apps in connection with such marketing, sales and advertising activities; and (ii) geographic tracking and carrier network preferences; (iii) information, such as age, gender and other information logged from your device to ensure that appropriate advertising is presented within the App, to calculate or control the number of views of an ad, to deliver ads relating to User&rsquo;s interests and to measure the effectiveness of ad campaigns. The delivery of ads to you may be based on IP address, device identifiers and other Personal Information gathered during your use of the &nbsp;Apps. You may also be presented with contextual or non-targeted ads, i.e. ads which are not directed towards specific Users but are rather broadly posted onto random Apps. If you chose to receive contextual or non-targeted ads only within our Apps, please be aware that you may still see some targeted ads served by third parties if you have separately (e.g. on that third party&rsquo;s website or app) agreed to personalized advertising directly to those third parties. .. Note that if you click on any of these ads, the advertisers may use cookies and other tracking technologies (such as tracking pixel agent or visitor identification technology, etc.) on your device to collect data regarding ad performance, your interaction with such ads and our &nbsp;Apps and your interests (which may include, non-personal and/or personal information such as, device and network information, unique identifiers, gender, age and geo-location about you) in order to serve you ads, including targeted ads, and for the legitimate business interests of such Third Parties ad networks.

These Third Parties are carefully selected to ensure that they, and their related entities who may access Your information, provide Your information with equal protection to that stated in this Privacy Policy and required by applicable privacy laws and the Platform Providers&rsquo; rules, policies and guidelines. We use commercially reasonable efforts to engage with Third Parties that post a privacy policy governing their collection, retention, processing and use of non-personal and personal information. For further information regarding the collection, processing and usage of your information by the Third Parties, please review their privacy policy practices.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">8. The User&rsquo;s compliance with Certain Additional Terms and Conditions</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">A User&rsquo;s access to and use of the Apps (including use of promotional codes ) may be subject to certain third party terms and conditions and privacy policies, including but not limited to those of application stores, mobile software platforms, Third Parties and payment providers. We do not exercise control of such third parties and are not responsible for their privacy practices and their use of the Users&rsquo; personal information. You should review the privacy policies of these third parties to learn how they may collect and use your Personal Information.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">9. Links to third party sites</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Certain links provided in the Apps through ads or otherwise permit Users to leave our Apps and enter third party sites, products or services. These linked sites, products and services are not under our control. Most of such linked sites, products and services provide legal documents, including terms of use and privacy policies, governing the use of these sites. It is always advisable to read such documents carefully before using those sites and services so that you know what kind of information they are collecting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">10. Cookies &amp; Local Storage</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">When you access or use the Apps, we and/or our Third Parties may use industry-wide technologies such as &ldquo;cookies&rdquo;, web beacons, tags and local storage (or other similar technologies), which store certain local information on your device (&ldquo;</span><span class="c3 c5">Local Storage</span><span class="c2">&rdquo;), to identify a User&rsquo;s device and &lsquo;remember&rsquo; things about the User which may enable automatic activation of certain features (for example, if a User muted the sound within the App at a certain stage, this preference will be stored in the cache on the device and maintained the next time the User accesses the App on his device), monitoring of use of the Apps (counting Users who visit certain pages, use certain tools, viewed certain advertisements), frequency capping (for example, if we promote another App, this ensures that we do not advertise the same App more than a set number of times), to improve the quality of our services, measure ad performance, provide relevant ads etc. and making the User&rsquo;s App experience and usage simpler, more relevant, convenient and effortless. Such information is locally stored in the User&rsquo;s device. We and/or our Third Parties may access such information. Third Parties may use both session cookies (which expire once you close the App) and persistent cookies (which stay on the User&rsquo;s device until he/she deletes them). Such Local Storage used by the Apps may store non-personal information (such as the different pages viewed by a User within the App) as well as User persistent identifier and geo-location data, which will be collected in accordance with the terms specified herein. It is easy to prohibit and/or delete the Local Storage, including via uninstalling the App from your mobile device and/or through the Settings option of your device. Most browsers and platforms will allow you to erase cookies from a device, block acceptance of cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. In order to erase or disable the Local Storage option you may use the settings option of your device or according to the specific instructions provided by the technology provider and/or Third Parties privacy policies and terms of use. However, if you block or erase cookies, or change the settings of your device, your App experience may be affected and may be limited.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">11. &ldquo;Do Not Track&rdquo; and Opt-out of Certain Third Parties&rsquo; Interest-Based Services</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">A User may prevent or limit targeted advertising from device settings which may vary from device to device. For example, if you are using an iOS device with iOS 7 or a newer version, this can be done from settings/privacy/advertising by resetting advertising identifier or limiting ad tracking setting. If you are using a Google Android device with Android 2.3 or a later version, you can find the ad identifier settings in the app drawer under Google Settings&gt; Ads. Please note that activation of any applicable &ldquo;Do-not-track&rdquo; settings on the User&rsquo;s mobile device or any other device-level setting opt outs for targeted advertising, (to the extent such options exist) may not cease all tracking activities by our Third Parties&rsquo; service providers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If you would like to cease the tracking by third parties of your on-line activities over time and across different online platforms (such as, websites, applications, etc.) and opt out of the use of your information for interest-based and targeted advertising and/or other services by certain of our third party service providers, please visit the privacy practices of such Third Parties and follow the instructions specified therein.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Note that electing to opt-out will not stop advertising from appearing in your browser or applications, but may make the ads you see less relevant to your interests, and the companies you select may still collect information for other purposes, such as research, analytics, and internal operations. In addition, note that if you use a different browser or erase cookies from your browser, or use a different mobile device, you may need to renew your opt-out choice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">12. International Data Transfer</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">We may transfer (and store) information collected about you, including Personal Information, to affiliated entities, or to other third party service providers across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world (all solely for legitimate business purposes). Please note that we may transfer such information to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction, wherever your Personal Information is transferred we will take reasonable steps to ensure the protection of your Personal Information (such as making transfers subject to standard contractual terms or engaging with host providers which are privacy-shield certified or offer an equivalent level of protection). &nbsp;Where we receive requests for information from law enforcement or regulators, we will carefully validate these requests before Personal Information is disclosed. You can ask for more details of the steps we take by contacting us as set out in the &ldquo;Got Any Questions&rdquo; section below. We will centralize all privacy-related decisions in (and the Personal Information may be accessed from) countries that are declared as offering an adequate level of protection of personal data by the European Commission.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">13.
